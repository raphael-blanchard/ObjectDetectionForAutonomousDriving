Here is an example when running a prediction on a single image, with on the left the raw image and on the right the image returned by the neural network:

Now, when running a prediction on each frame of a video from a dashcam (fig 2.) and putting them together, we get a video (fig 1.) with labeled bounding boxes for each detected object, for each frame.
